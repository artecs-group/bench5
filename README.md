# bench5
This script is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. Make sure you install `subprocess32` if you want to use the former.

The target benchmark suite can be specified at the beginning of the `bench5.py` file. CPU and cache parameters have to be set in the 
`simparams.py` file. Many other options can be passed as command-line arguments.

Execute with option `-h` to show the help.
